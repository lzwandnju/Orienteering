– "Orienteering" – Abstract 

The aim of this game is to arrive at the goal (G) from the start (S) with the shortest distance. 
However, the players have to pass all the checkpoints (@) on the map. 

An orienteering map is to be given in the following format. 

########
#@....G#
##.##@##
#..@..S#
#@.....#

##############
#@.@..@#.....#

In this problem, an orienteering map is to be given. 
Calculate the minimum distance from the start to the goal with passing all the checkpoints. 

Specification 
* 
A map consists of 5 characters as following. You can assume that the map does not contain any invalid characters and the map has exactly one start symbol 'S' and exactly one goal symbol 'G'. 

* 
'S' means the orienteering start. 

* 
'G' means the orienteering goal. 


* 
'@' means an orienteering checkpoint. 

* 
'.' means an opened-block that players can pass. 

* 
'#' means a closed-block that players cannot pass. 

* 
It is allowed to move only by one step vertically or horizontally (up, down, left, or right) to the next block. 

Other types of movements, such as moving diagonally (left up, right up, left down and right down) and skipping one or more blocks, are NOT permitted.
